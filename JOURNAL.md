This is my journal of the design and building process of **Ion (Corona Discharge Engraver)**.

## 10/19/2025 10 AM - Research  

There are a few goals I want to achieve with this machine.

-Adjustable 50kV positive voltage potential (At the moment, 50kV seems to be a solid amount but I might increase it to 100kV later down the line)
-Sharp tungsten electrodes with adequate grounding for high amounts of discharge
-Ozone ventilation (the machine produces a lot of ozone)
-Neon bulbs (i would like to use gas filled bulbs as indicator lights etc and also larger gas tubes)
-Modular toolheads in order to change discharge shape
-Water electrolysis (oxygen production) to fuel the discharge possibly
-Audio modulation in order to make the machine play music with the plasma

I would like it to be a nice proof of concept to demonstrate that corona discharge engraving (which has not been done before) is a viable alternative to other methods such as lasers and hot wires.![maxresdefault.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjgyNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--cd5afaa8cf97824e0d94876fd862a9832db00582/maxresdefault.jpg)
  

## 10/19/2025 2 PM - Made the y-axis  

Made the frame out of 2020 extrusions and some corner brackets
Dual steppers for the y-axis
Added double shear for the idlers and motor
Made mounts for everything
Designed belt tensioners on the idler side

The y-axis is basically finished, might need some minor tweaks later though
